# Flappy-Bird-

Description: This project is a replica of the local, single-player, mobile game ‘Flappy Bird’. The player is tasked with navigating the bird through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. The bird automatically descends and only ascends upon pressing the spacebar. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point. The player wins when 10 points are obtained. Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the gameplay.
